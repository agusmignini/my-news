# RR COURSE - BaSD 2021 :rocket:
## First week proyect
Resolution of the first problematic of Radium Rocket's course: "Become a Software Developer - 2021".
### Description
The problematic of the first week consists of selecting a news article and creating an HTML document that has the same content as the article, such as:
- main title
- subtitles
- videos
- images
- text
- audio, among others

Also, progress must be saved in a public GitHub repository.
### Resolution
The following news was chosen: [La carta de Cristina Kirchner que dinamita al Frente de Todos](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/politica/la-debilidad-de-cristina-kirchner-y-el-peligro-de-una-implosion-del-frente-de-todos-nid16092021/ "La carta de Cristina Kirchner que dinamita al Frente de Todos")

The project was made using only HTML.
## Second week proyect
Resolution of the second problematic of Radium Rocket's course: "Become a Software Developer -2021".
### Description
The problematic of this week consists of selecting a news article from a different newspaper and creating an HTML document that has the same content as the article and style it with CSS to make the page look identical to the original diary.  This should be done for both the new news and the one we created in week 1.

Like the first problematic, progress must be saved in a public GitHub repository.
### Resolution
The following news was chosen: [Here's exactly how much bigger the iPhone 13 batteries are](https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22678607/iphone-13-reported-battery-sizes-increase-laptop-comparison "Here’s exactly how much bigger the iPhone 13 batteries are")

The project was made using HTML ans CSS.
## GitHub Pages
You can see my **first week project** following this link: [GitHub Page 1](https://agusmignini.github.io/my-news/ "GitHub Page 1")
You can see my **second week proyect** following this link: [GitHub Page 2](https://agusmignini.github.io/my-news/news-2 "GitHub Page 2")
### ***Notes***
1. The index.html file doesn't look like the news-2 file since the style was made based on the latter.
2. The icons of Facebok, Twitter, share and user were not taken into account.
3. The video under the section "featured from the verge" changes when you reload the page of the original news so it will not be the same as I chose.
4. The fonts aren´t the same in the titles and in certain elements since you have to pay to use them.
